# AI Compliance Checker

> An AI-powered asset review tool that helps organizations (events, franchises) check sponsor/franchisee submissions against brand guidelines.

**Business Model:** $5K-8K setup + $300-500/month per client  
**Target Revenue:** $300K-400K/year with 25-30 clients  
**Founder:** Sean Higgins (AWS Partner Marketing Contractor, building lifestyle business)

## 🎯 What It Does

Organizations deploy custom AI "gatekeepers" that sit between submitters and reviewers:
- Submitters upload assets (logos, banners, social, print)
- AI instantly checks against client-specific brand guidelines
- **NEW:** AI learns from reference images uploaded by admins
- Submitters fix issues before formal submission
- Reviewers only see compliant assets
- **Result:** Eliminate 70%+ of back-and-forth revision cycles

## 🗄 Database Schema (Supabase)

### Table 1: `asset_types`

**Purpose:** Store compliance guidelines and reference images for each asset category

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE asset_types (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text NOT NULL,              -- "logo", "banner", "social", "print"
  description text,                -- "Brand logos and marks"
  guidelines text,                 -- Full markdown guidelines (no size limit)
  reference_images jsonb,          -- Array of reference image objects
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Reference Images Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://supabase.co/.../reference-images/logo/1234-abc.png",
    "fileName": "apple-logo.png",
    "storagePath": "reference-images/logo/1234-abc.png"
  }
]
```

### Table 2: `submissions`

**Purpose:** Track every asset upload and AI analysis result

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  asset_type text NOT NULL,
  file_name text NOT NULL,
  file_url text NOT NULL,
  result text NOT NULL,            -- 'pass' or 'fail'
  confidence_score integer,        -- 0-100
  violations jsonb,                -- Array of violation strings
  submitted_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Table 3: `app_settings`

**Purpose:** Global application configuration (ghost mode, etc.)

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE app_settings (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  setting_key text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  setting_value jsonb NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Storage Bucket: `assets`

**Purpose:** Store uploaded asset files and reference images

**Configuration:**
- **Bucket name:** `assets`
- **Public access:** ❌ DISABLED (Private bucket)
- **Access method:** Signed URLs with 1-hour expiration
- **Folder structure:** 
  - `submissions/[timestamp]-[random].[ext]` - Submitted assets
  - `reference-images/[asset-type]/[timestamp]-[random].[ext]` - Reference images

✅ **Security Status (Updated December 27, 2024):**
1. ✅ Bucket is private
2. ✅ Signed URLs implemented (1-hour expiration)
3. ✅ server.js generates signed URLs using `createSignedUrl()`
4. ✅ Tested and working for uploads, downloads, and reference images

## 🔧 Environment Variables

**Root `.env` file:**
```env
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Supabase Backend Credentials
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key_here
```

**Client `.env` file:**
```env
# Admin Dashboard Password
REACT_APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Supabase Frontend Credentials
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** React requires `.env` file in `client/` folder, NOT in root.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm installed
- Supabase account with project created
- OpenAI API key

### Setup:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd ~/Downloads/asset-review-tool-main-3/

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..

# 3. Create environment files
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

cp client/.env.example client/.env
# Edit client/.env and add your keys

# 4. Start development servers (both backend and frontend)
npm run dev
```

**What happens:**
- Backend starts on `http://localhost:3001`
- React frontend starts on `http://localhost:3000`
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` for submitter interface
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin` for admin dashboard

## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### 1. Dynamic Asset Types

Admins can create/edit/delete asset types through the admin dashboard. Each asset type has:
- **Name** (e.g., "Logo", "Banner")
- **Description** (brief explanation)
- **Guidelines** (detailed markdown compliance rules)
- **Reference Images** (optional visual examples)

Asset types load dynamically on the submitter interface - no hardcoding!

### 2. Reference Images (AI Visual Learning)

**How it works:**
1. Admin uploads 1+ reference images per asset type
2. Images stored in Supabase Storage at `reference-images/{asset-type}/`
3. When submission is analyzed:
   - Backend fetches reference images from database
   - Downloads and converts to base64
   - Includes in OpenAI API call BEFORE submission image
   - AI compares submission against references
4. Dramatically improves accuracy for logo recognition and visual compliance

**Use cases:**
- Specific logo matching (e.g., "must use THIS Apple logo")
- Color palette examples
- Layout/composition references
- Typography examples

### 3. Ghost Mode

**Purpose:** Validate AI accuracy during client onboarding without affecting submitters

**How it works:**
1. Admin enables ghost mode in Settings tab
2. Submitters upload normally
3. AI analyzes in background
4. Submitters see generic "Submitted" message (no pass/fail)
5. Admins see full AI analysis in Submissions tab
6. Admin compares AI decisions to their own judgment
7. Once 85%+ accuracy confirmed, disable ghost mode

**Why it's important:** Builds client trust before going live

### 4. Submissions History

View and filter all past submissions:
- **Filter by asset type:** Logo, Banner, etc.
- **Filter by result:** Pass, Fail, All
- **Filter by date:** Today, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, All Time
- **Detail modal:** Click "View Details" to see full image, violations, download link

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:

1. **File formats:** Only PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP (no PDF, video, PPTX yet)
2. **Signed URL expiration:** URLs expire after 1 hour (expected behavior - enhances security)
3. **Authentication:** Single shared admin password
4. **No submitter accounts:** Anyone can upload
5. **No email notifications:** No automated communication
6. **No submission workflow:** Just pass/fail, no approval process
7. **Single deployment:** All test data in one database

### Known Bugs:

- "Download File" opens in new tab instead of downloading (expected behavior for images)
- Admin session persists indefinitely (no expiration)
- No pagination on submissions (could be slow with 1,000+ records)

---

## 🎯 TODO Before First Pilot

### Should-Do (Functionality):
- [ ] Create 3-4 comprehensive guideline examples
- [ ] Test AI accuracy with 20-30 sample assets
- [ ] Refine prompts based on test results
- [ ] Add better error messages
- [ ] Create client onboarding checklist

### Nice-to-Have (Polish):
